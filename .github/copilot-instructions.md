# Copilot Instructions for JavaScript-By-chai-or-code

This project is a collection of JavaScript learning modules, organized by topic and concept. It is designed for self-paced study and experimentation, with each file focusing on a specific aspect of JavaScript.

## Project Structure
- Each numbered folder (e.g., `01_basic.js`, `02_basic.js`, etc.) contains topic-focused `.js` files.
- No build system, package manager, or external dependencies are present; all code is plain JavaScript.
- The `06_DOM/01_HTML.html` file is for basic DOM manipulation and HTML/JS integration.

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- Each `.js` file is standalone and demonstrates a single concept (e.g., variables, arrays, objects, loops).
- Naming follows the format: `NN_topic.js` for folders and `NN_concept.js` for files, where `NN` is a sequence number.
- Code is written for clarity and demonstration, not production. Expect direct `console.log` usage and minimal error handling.
- No module imports/exports; all code is intended to be run directly in Node.js or a browser console.

## Developer Workflow
- To run a file, use: `node <path-to-file>` in the terminal (e.g., `node 01_basic.js/01_variable.js`).
- No automated tests or build steps; manual execution and inspection are the primary workflow.
- For DOM examples, open the HTML file in a browser and inspect the console/output.

## Examples
- Iteration patterns: See `05_itration.js/04_itration.js` for both `for...in` (object keys) and `for...of` (array values) usage.
- Object and array manipulation: `02_basic.js/03_object.js`, `02_basic.js/01_array.js`.
- Function scope and parameters: `03_basic.js/01_function_parameter.js`, `03_basic.js/03_scope.js`.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Focus on clear, educational code samples. Avoid introducing frameworks, libraries, or advanced patterns.
- When adding new files, follow the existing naming and organizational conventions.
- If updating code, preserve the didactic style and direct output (e.g., `console.log`).
- Reference existing files for examples of style and structure before introducing new concepts.

## Integration Points
- No external APIs or services are integrated.
- All code is self-contained and intended for local execution.
